# TNSPC Group 1 Statistics Web Application
An initiative of the TNPSC Aspirants and Alumni Research Study

## About
The Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) published detailed data from the 2019 Group 1 exam. This web application uses that data to print statistics on how well candidates with a particular background performed on the exam in the past.

How can this app be used?
* Candidates can use this information to compare their past performance with people from a similar background
* Individuals who want to help candidates who are struggling to get selected can identify the regions of Tamil Nadu with the lowest selection rates
