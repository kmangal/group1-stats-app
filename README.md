# TNSPC Group 1 Statistics Web Application
An initiative of the TNPSC Aspirants and Alumni Research Study

## About
The Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) published detailed data from the 2019 Group 1 exam. This web application uses that data to print statistics on how well candidates with a particular background performed on the exam in the past.

How can this app be used?
* Candidates that are unsure about whether it is worth the effort to study for the exam can look up what their chances are likely to be.
* Candidates can use this information to compare their past performance to other candidates from a similar background.
* Individuals who want to help candidates who are struggling to get selected can identify the subpopulations of candidates with the lowest selection rates

## Data
This app uses data made available through TNPSC's Open Data Policy, available [here](https://tnpsc.gov.in/English/OpenDataPolicy.aspx). Once the files are downloaded, the code in process.R processes it into the format used by the applicaiton.
